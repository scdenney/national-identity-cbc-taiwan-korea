## Project Overview

How do citizens in historically ethnic nations that have undergone democratic transitions define who belongs? This project explores national identity boundaries in Taiwan and South Korea ‚Äî two third-wave democracies with divergent post-authoritarian identity trajectories. We field a two-part choice-based conjoint (CBC) experiment to examine how individuals assess the national membership of hypothetical co-nationals across a range of ascriptive, civic, and voluntarist traits.

The research addresses well-known limitations of traditional survey methods and contributes to ongoing debates about identity pluralization in democratizing societies.

## Research Questions

- What traits do citizens in Taiwan and South Korea consider necessary to be a ‚Äútrue‚Äù member of the nation?
- Do democratic transitions shift identity logics away from ancestry and ethnicity toward civic or voluntarist criteria?
- How do public judgments about national belonging vary across country contexts and identity subtypes?

## Methodology

We conducted a nationally representative online survey in both countries (N=2,050 in Taiwan; N=2,006 in South Korea) in 2023‚Äì2024. Each respondent completed two CBC tasks:

1. **General CBC** ‚Äì captures cross-nationally comparable criteria like language ability, citizenship, and birthplace.  
2. **Country-Specific CBC** ‚Äì tailors attributes to each country‚Äôs identity cleavages, e.g., diaspora status in Korea and cross-Strait identification in Taiwan.

Each profile is evaluated using both forced-choice and rating-scale outcomes. Results are analyzed via OLS models with clustered standard errors to estimate marginal means and average marginal component effects (AMCEs).

## Country Comparison

- **Taiwan**: Voluntarist signals such as self-identifying as Taiwanese and support for democracy are the most influential criteria of inclusion.
- **South Korea**: While civic and voluntarist attributes matter, ethnic ancestry and nativity remain more central than in Taiwan.
- These patterns reflect divergent nation-building trajectories and the variable impact of democratic consolidation on identity regimes.
